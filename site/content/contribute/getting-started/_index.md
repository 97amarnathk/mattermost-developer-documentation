# Getting Started

Welcome to the Mattermost project!

We're very glad that you want to help contribute and our goal here is to make that as easy as possible and to make the learning curve as smooth as possible.

First it's probably a good idea to familiarize yourself with [the different repositories of the Mattermost project](/contribute/getting-started/respositories/).

After reading that you'll want to get [your developer environment set up](/contribute/getting-started/developer-setup/).

Finally, before you go submitting a pull request make sure to give [the contribution guidelines a read](/contribute/getting-started/contribution-guidelines/).
