Below are the proposal categories for applicants of Mattermost for Google Summer of Code. Please cite one of  the 
categories in your application proposal.

### Extensions

Mattermost is moving towards building upon and improving the extensibility and plugability of the platform. This 
means that whenever possible new feature are defaulted to being build via plugins or extensions.

Plugins can be frontend, backend, or a combination of the two. Here are some examples:

* [Zoom meeting plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-zoom)
* [Github plugin](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-github)
* [Auto-linker](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugin-autolink)
* [Mailermost, which allows for replying to an email notification](https://github.com/DSchalla/mailermost-plugin)
* [etc...](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-plugins/blob/master/index.md)

You can learn more via the [plugins documentation](https://docs.mattermost.com/administration/plugins.html). Do you
have an idea for a plugin or an extension? We'd love to hear about it.

### Product

There are lots of ways to improve Mattermost (desktop, API, webapp, mobileapp). Some ideas are listed in the 
[Jira instance](https://mattermost.atlassian.net/secure/Dashboard.jspa). Among those, some are in development and 
others haven't been started. Of course there are lots of ideas that haven't even been thought of yet!

Do you have an idea for improving the product or do you have an interest in implementing one of the existing ideas? 
Maybe you've used something in another tool that you Mattermost could use? Maybe you have a novel idea. The sky's 
the limit!

### Code

There are lots of ways that the various code bases ([webapp](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-webapp), [desktop](https://github.com/mattermost/desktop), [mobile](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-mobile), and [server](https://github.com/mattermost/mattermost-server)) can be improved architecturally and from security and performance
perspectives.

Some examples might include:

* Converting JavaScript to TypeScript
* Improving the mobileapp or webapp performance
* Refactoring some code or rearchitecting a tier of the code base

No experience with Mattermost code is necessary, just bring your interests, ideas, and unique technical expertise.

### Process

Perhaps you're process-oriented thinker and see ways that Mattermost could improve somehow. This might include the 
development workflows, product management, continuous delivery, community involvement. Whatever it is
we're interesting in improving upon it. Again, sky's the limit here too; sometimes the biggest impacts come from 
fresh sets of eyes who don't yet accept the status quo. Is that you?
